# AI_LOCK — Active Session Coordination

**Schema purpose:** Coordinates multi-AI work on the same branch. Every AI session reads this file before any file edit. Updated in the same commit as the work it describes — no standalone "claim lock" or "release lock" commits.

## Active session

**Active branch:** none
**Active AI:** none
**Active layer:** none
**Locked files:** (none)
**Session start:** —

## Rules

1. Read this file before any edit on this branch.
2. Refuse to touch any path listed in `Locked files` if `Active AI` is set and is not you.
3. Update this file in the **same commit** as the work it describes.
4. On standdown, clear `Active AI`, `Active layer`, and `Locked files` in your final commit.
5. If `git status` shows changes you did not make, **STOP** and ask the owner.
6. Charter changes (`LAW_*` tier docs) are Opus-only.
7. High-risk L4 work (`supabase/functions/`, auth/storage invariants) is Opus-only.

## Layer assignment guidance

Per [`docs/LAW_LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/LAW_LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE.md):

- L1 (design primitives) — `src/styles/`, `src/app/theme/`, `src/app/components/ui/`, `src/app/components/atmosphere/`
- L2 (screens) — `src/app/components/{landing,dashboard,maps,shop,insurer,codelayer,reports,admin}/`, `src/app/pages/`
- L3 (orchestration) — `src/app/features/`, `src/app/hooks/`
- L4 (services + edge) — `src/app/services/`, `supabase/functions/`, `supabase/migrations/`

Parallel AI work (one AI per layer) is only enabled after Phase 3 lock dry run + Phase 4 mobile sweep both ship clean.

## Hard stops (no AI proceeds)

- LAW conflicts
- Destructive data changes (DROP, DELETE without WHERE, force-push to main)
- Auth/storage invariants (verify_jwt change, signed-URL persistence)
- Schema migrations without owner authorization
- Provider changes (MapLibre → Mapbox, Clerk → other)
- Deploy/secret actions
- Overwriting unrelated work
- Touching [`docs/MOLANDJESUS_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](docs/MOLANDJESUS_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) — locked apex design doc, no merges/edits/splits ever

## Skills applied schema

When a session uses a reusable AI skill, list it here so future agents can find the pattern source. Example values: `bd-design-identity`, `mola-ai-relay-protocol`, `supabase-clerk-edge-function`, `supabase-storage-signed-urls`, `supabase-pro-cost-control`.
